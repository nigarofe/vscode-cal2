# Introdução à campos escalares e vetoriais

## Notation and Preliminaries

We denote by $\mathbb{R}^n$ the $n$-dimensional real coordinate space:

$$
\mathbb{R}^1 = \{(x)\mid x\in\mathbb{R}\},\quad
\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(x,y)\mid x,y\in\mathbb{R}\},\quad
\mathbb{R}^3 = \{(x,y,z)\mid x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}\}.
$$

Throughout, we use
- a lower-case letter $f$ to denote a scalar field, i.e.\ a function that assigns a real number to each point in space;
- an upper-case letter $F$ (or $\mathbf{F}$, $\vec{F}$) to denote a vector field, i.e.\ a function that assigns a vector to each point in space.

## 1D: Scalar vs. Vector Fields

On the real line $\mathbb{R}^1$, points are just $x\in\mathbb{R}$.

### Scalar field
$$f(x):\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$$
Interpretation: “At position $x$, the temperature is $f(x)^\circ\mathrm{C}$.”

Examples:
- Height of a wall as you walk along its base: if $x$ metres from one end, $f(x)$ metres is the wall’s height.
- Water depth along a channel: $f(x)$ metres deep at position $x$.

### Vector field

$$F(x):\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^1$$
In 1D every “vector” has only one component, so we rarely distinguish $F(x)$ from $f(x)$.  
Interpretation: “At position $x$, the force on a test particle is $F(x)$ newtons to the right (or left if negative).”

## 2D: Adding a Second Dimension

Now points are $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$.

### Scalar field

$$f(x,y):\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$$

Interpretation: “The temperature on a flat metal plate.”

Examples:
- Elevation of a hill: at coordinate $(x,y)$, the altitude is $f(x,y)$.
- Pressure on a lake’s surface: $f(x,y)$ kPa at $(x,y)$.

Visualization: level curves (contours) where $f(x,y)=C$.

### Vector field

$$\mathbf{F}(x,y)=\langle P(x,y),\,Q(x,y)\rangle:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$$ 
Interpretation: “Wind velocity at each point on a map.”

Examples:
- Fluid flow in a shallow pond: $\mathbf{F}(x,y)$ gives the speed and direction of the current at $(x,y)$.
- Electric field near charged plates: $\mathbf{F}(x,y)$ points from positive to negative regions.

Visualization: arrow-plots showing an arrow at each $(x,y)$ with components $\langle P,Q\rangle$.

## 3D: The Physical World

Points now live in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3$.

### Scalar field

$$f(x,y,z):\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}$$  
Interpretation: “Temperature inside a room.”

Examples:
- Density of air at each point $(x,y,z)$.
- Gravitational potential field: the potential energy per unit mass.

### Vector field

$$
\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=\langle P(x,y,z),\,Q(x,y,z),\,R(x,y,z)\rangle:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3.
$$

Interpretation: “Velocity of water in a river, wind in the atmosphere, or force fields.”

Examples:
- Velocity field of a fluid: at each point, $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)$ is the local fluid velocity vector.
- Electric field in space: vector at each $(x,y,z)$ giving magnitude and direction of force on a positive test charge.
- Magnetic field around a magnet: $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)$ gives both strength and orientation.

## Why It Matters
**Scalar fields** model quantities that have magnitude only (temperature, pressure, density, potential).  
**Vector fields** model quantities that have both magnitude and direction (velocity, force, electromagnetic fields).

These ideas form the foundation for
- Differential operators like gradient $\nabla f$ (turns a scalar field into a vector field),
- Divergence $\nabla\cdot F$ (measures “outflow” of a vector field),
- Curl $\nabla\times F$ (measures “rotation” of a vector field),

and ultimately the calculus of multivariable fields used in physics, engineering and geometry.
